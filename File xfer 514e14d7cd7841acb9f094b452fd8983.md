# File xfer

Certainly! Here are some alternatives to Transfer.sh that provide secure file transfers without storing files permanently:

1. **File.io**: File.io allows you to upload files with a specified expiration time. Once the file is downloaded or the time expires, the file is automatically deleted.
    
    Usage:
    
    ```bash
    curl -F "file=@/path/to/file" https://file.io
    ```
    
2. **Firefox Send**: Firefox Send is a service by Mozilla that allows you to upload and share files with end-to-end encryption. You can set an expiration time or download limit for the file.
